format simply rename — html file instance easily treat plain text rename filename.html filename.txt although strategy useful expert user easily understand manipulate information confuse less technical user accidentally file unusable " " rename incorrectly this lead version windows mac os hide extension list file this prevent user accidentally change file type allow expert user feature display extension hide extension create appearance identical filename folder for example logo .eps format publishing .png format web site with extension visible appear unique filename " companylogo.ep " " companylogo.png " on hide extension appear " companylogo " lead confusion hide extension pose security risk for example malicious user create executable innocent name " holiday photo.jpg.exe " the "

complex metadata thumbnail information require considerable display if header binary hard code header complex interpretation order recognize especially metadata content protection 's sake risk file
